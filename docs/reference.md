### Bump level

* `release` (default): Remove the pre-release extension; if any (0.1.0-alpha.1 -> 0.1.0, 0.1.0 -> 0.1.0).
* `patch`:
  * If version has a pre-release, then the pre-release extension is removed (0.1.0-alpha.1 -> 0.1.0).
  * Otherwise, bump the patch field (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
* `minor`: Bump minor version (0.1.0-pre -> 0.2.0)
* `major`: Bump major version (0.1.0-pre -> 1.0.0)
* `alpha`, `beta`, and `rc`: Add/increment pre-release to your version
  (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1-rc.1, 1.0.1-alpha -> 1.0.1-rc.1, 1.0.1-rc.1 ->
  1.0.1-rc.2)
* *[version]*: bump version to given version. The version has to
  be a valid semver string and greater than current version as in
  semver spec.

Note: fields are from the package-configuration unless otherwise specified.

### Supported Environment Variables

* `PUBLISH_GRACE_SLEEP`: sleep timeout between crates publish when releasing from workspace. This is a workaround to make previous crate discoverable on crates.io.

### Pre-release Replacements

This field is an array of tables with the following

* `file`: the file to search and replace
* `search`: [regex](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/) that matches string you want to replace
* `replace`: the replacement string; you can use any of the placeholders
  mentioned below. Regex patterns, such as `$1`, are also valid for referring to
  captured groups.
* `min` (default is `1`): Minimum occurrences of `search`.
* `max` (optional): Maximum occurrences of `search`.
* `exactly` (optional): Number of occurrences of `search`.
* `prerelease` (default is `false`): Run the replacement when bumping to a pre-release level.

See [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/blob/master/Cargo.toml) for example.

### Placeholders

The following fields support placeholders for information about your release:

- `pre-release-commit-message`
- `tag-message`
- `tag-prefix`
- `tag-name`
- `pre-release-hook`

The following placeholders are supported:

* `{{prev_version}}`: The version before `cargo-release` was executed (before any version bump).
* `{{prev_metadata}}`: The version's metadata before `cargo-release` was executed (before any version bump).
* `{{version}}`: The current (bumped) crate version.
  * Only works for `pre-release-commit-message` when `consolidate-commits = false` or when using `shared-version = true`.
* `{{metadata}}`: The current (bumped) crate version's metadata field.
* `{{crate_name}}`: The name of the current crate in `Cargo.toml`.
* `{{date}}`: The current date in `%Y-%m-%d` format.
* `{{prefix}}` (only valid for `tag-name` / `tag-message`): The value prepended to the tag name.
* `{{tag_name}}` (only valid for `tag-message`): The name of the git tag.

### Hook Environment Variables.

The following environment variables are made available to `pre-release-hook`:

* `PREV_VERSION`: The version before `cargo-release` was executed (before any version bump).
* `PREV_METADATA`: The version's metadata field before `cargo-release` was executed (before any version bump).
* `NEW_VERSION`: The current (bumped) crate version.
* `NEW_METADATA`: The current (bumped) crate version's metadata field.
* `DRY_RUN`: Whether the release is actually happening (`true` / `false`)
* `CRATE_NAME`: The name of the crate.
* `WORKSPACE_ROOT`: The path to the workspace.
* `CRATE_ROOT`: The path to the crate.
