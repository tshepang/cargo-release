  (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1-rc.1, 1.0.1-dev -> 1.0.1-rc.1, 1.0.1-rc.1 ->
  1.0.1-rc.2)

  be a valid semver string and greater than current version as in
  semver spec.

## Configuration

### Sources

Configuration is read from the following (in precedence order)

- Command line arguments
- File specified via `--config PATH`
- `$CRATE/Cargo.toml` (`[package.metadata.release]` table)
- `$CRATE/release.toml`
- `$WORKSPACE/release.toml`
- `$HOME/.release.toml`

### Config Fields

|----------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
|                | `--prev-tag-name` | string | Last released tag; used for seeing what changed in the current release (default based on `tag-name` and current version in `Cargo.toml`) |

| `sign-tag`     | `--sign-tag`    | bool   | Use GPG to sign git tag generated by cargo-release. |
| `push-remote`  | `--push-remote` | string | Default git remote to push |

| `disable-tag`  | `--skip-tag`    | bool   | Don't do git tag |

| `post-release-commit-message` | \- | string | A commit message template for bumping version after release. For example: `Released {{version}}, starting {{next_version}}`. The placeholder `{{next_version}}` (the version in git after release) is supported in addition to the global placeholders mentioned below. |
| `tag-message`  | \-              | string | A message template for tag. The placeholder `{{tag_name}}` and `{{prefix}}` (the tag prefix) is supported in addition to the global placeholders mentioned below. |

| `pre-release-hook` | \-          | list of arguments | Provide a command to run before `cargo-release` commits version change. If the return code of hook command is greater than 0, the release process will be aborted. |

| `all-features` | `--all-features` | bool  | Signal to `cargo publish`, that all features should be used (requires rust 1.33+) |

### {Pre,Post}-release Replacements

This field is an array of tables with the following

* `file`: the file to search and replace
* `search`: regex that matches string you want to replace
* `replace`: the replacement string; you can use the any of the placeholders mentioned below.
* `min` (default is `1`): Minimum occurrences of `search`.
* `max` (optional): Maximum occurrences of `search`.
* `exactly` (optional): Number of occurrences of `search`.
* `prerelease` (default is `false`): Run the replacement when bumping to a pre-release level.

See [release.toml](https://github.com/sunng87/cargo-release/blob/master/release.toml) for example.

### Placeholders

The following placeholders in configuration values will be be replaced with the desired value:

* `{{prev_version}}`: The version before `cargo-release` was executed (before any version bump).
* `{{version}}`: The current (bumped) crate version.
* `{{next_version}}` (only valid for `post-release-{commit-message,replacements}`): The crate version for starting development.
* `{{crate_name}}`: The name of the current crate in `Cargo.toml`.
* `{{date}}`: The current date in `%Y-%m-%d` format.
* `{{prefix}}` (only valid for `tag-name` / `tag-message`): The value prepended to the tag name.
* `{{tag_name}}` (only valid for `tag-message`): The name of the git tag.

### Hook Environment Variables.

The following environment variables are made available to `pre-release-hook`:

* `PREV_VERSION`: The version before `cargo-release` was executed (before any version bump).
* `NEW_VERSION`: The current (bumped) crate version.
* `DRY_RUN`: Whether the release is actually happening (`true` / `false`)
* `CRATE_NAME`: The current (bumped) crate version.
* `WORKSPACE_ROOT`: The path to the workspace.
* `CRATE_ROOT`: The path to the crate.
